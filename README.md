# face_brainwave_data

The dataset included here is electrophsiological data collegected using an electroencephologram. 
Data were recorded from 30 scalp channels, in response to 300 visually presented stimuli. 
There were 6 seperate item types. 
The "measures" column indicates the mean amplitude of a subjects electrical brain acticity at any given electrode (column "chan") between 155 and 175 ms after the stimulus was presented on the screen. 
The "bin" column indicates which stimulus type the subject was looking at. 
Bins 7-56 were words, bins 57-106 were also words that were stretched to match the dimensions of the objects bin, bins 107 - 156 were a novel class of stimuli (words that are shaped like their meaning, e.g., the word smile shaped like a smile), ins 157 - 206 were animals, bins 207 - 256 were human faces, and bins 257 - 306 were objects.  

words = 7:56
size matched words 57:106
ambiguous items = 107:156
animals: 157: 206
faces: 207:256
%obs = 257:306

The final two colums indicate the start and end time of the mean amplitude measurement.
